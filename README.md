# Jets Program

## Description



The jets program allows users to see a inventory list from an airfield. The user is present with the following options:

- List fleet
- Fly all jets
- View fastest jet
- View jet with longest range
- Load all Cargo Jets
- Dogfight!
- Add a jet to Fleet
- Remove a jet from Fleet
- Quit

Via the menu, the user has access to various inventory lists, as well as has the ability to make additions and subtractions to the list. Overall, this project was very challenging for me, but once completed, I felt very proud that I was able to pull it all together. I think it could still use some work, but it is working as best as possible given the challenges experienced!


## Technologies Used
1. Java
2. Git

## Lessons Learned
- There is an inherent difficulty when it comes to using multiple classes. I had a lot of trouble with getting the Jets Application to communicate (for lack of a better term) with the Airfield. After a lot of blood, sweat and tears, I figured it out!
- Determining where methods should go was challenging. I originally started out with all my logic/code in the Jets Application. After seeking help from the best TAs, I realized that the user does not need to see all of that, and subsequently placed it in airfield.
